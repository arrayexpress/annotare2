Comment[Submitted Name]	Transfection of HaCaT cells with HPV11 HPV16 or HPV45 genome
Experiment Description	We investigated the early stage of HPV infections by global expression profiling in a cell model, in which cells from the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, were transfected with HPV11, HPV16 or HPV45 genomes ( methods used for transfection are described in PubMed ID: 21078297)

Protocol Description	The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was chosen for the present study. The cells were grown at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. For cell cultivation Dulbecco_s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM 1965, Invit- rogen) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 1% Penicillin/ Streptomycin, 1% Glutamate and 1% 0.1 M sodium pyruvate was used. Transfections were done using jetPEITM transfection reagent (Polyplus transfections). For stable transfection the circularized genome (6 lg) was transfected together with the pSV2-neo selec- tion vector (2 lg) into HaCaT cells seeded 2 x 10^6 cell per 10 cm plate. As control, cells were transfected with the selection vector alone. The cells were grown under standard conditions using the same passage number and maintained under selection with G418 sulfate (Invitrogen) in a concentration of 500 lg per ml.  (methods used for transfection are described in PubMed ID: 21078297)	Total RNA was extracted in TriZOL reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen).	Total RNA (100ng) was amplified and labelled using the Ambion WT Expression Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers instructions. 	The labelled samples were hybridised to the Human Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Arrays were washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE) using an Affymetrix Fluidics Station? 450 	RMA was peformed as implemented in oligo package with default settings.  R code: affyGeneFS <- read.celfiles(geneCELs); geneCore <- rma(affyGeneFS, target = core)
