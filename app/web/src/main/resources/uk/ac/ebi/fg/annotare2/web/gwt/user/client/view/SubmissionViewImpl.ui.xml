            <p>Transcription profiling of human brain total RNA vs Universal Human Reference RNA on 4 different
                commercially available microarray to assess comparability of gene expression measurements on microarrays
                (24 assays)
            </p>
            <p>Commercially available human genomic microarrays from four different manufacturers were used to compare
                Human Brain Total RNA against Universal Human Reference RNA (both commercially available) prepared at
                two different starting amounts (20 µg or 1µg). For each amount of RNA, 6 replicates were performed with
                Human Brain Total RNA labelled with Cy3, and Universal Human Reference RNA labelled with Cy5. The
                labelling was then reversed (dye flip) creating another 6 replicates. This meant that for each of the
                four manufacturers there were a total of 24 arrays. Image processing was performed with two different
                software packages, and data was normalized with three different strategies.
