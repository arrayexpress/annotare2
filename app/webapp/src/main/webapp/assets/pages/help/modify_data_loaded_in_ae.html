    <h2>Modify or remove an experiment or array design which has been loaded into ArrayExpress</h2>

    <h3 id="changeDate">Release date changes</h3>
    <p>Reminders about experiment and array design release dates are sent to submitters 7, 30 and 60 days before the current release date.</p>
    <p>The release date can be changed using the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/acext/">
        ArrayExpress access control tool</a>. Simply login with the data access account details which we emailed you when curation was completed,
        click the calendar symbol next to the private experiment for which you would like to change the release date, and follow on-screen instructions. You would normally have used these account details to log in to the ArrayExpress website and view your private experiment(s). Don't worry if you have forgotten the username and/or password, you can <a href="/arrayexpress/help/how_to_search.html#Login">retrieve login details</a> using your submitter's email address and the experiment accession number.</p>

      <h3 id="addPublication">Add a publication link</h3>
    <p>The publication field can be modified at any time after loading the experiment into the database. Log in to the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/acext/"> ArrayExpress access control tool</a> with the data access account details which we emailed you when curation was completed. Select the experiment in the upper panel, and view the linked publication details in the lower panel. Click on "Add" or "Edit" to add a new publication or update an existing publication record.</p>

    <h3 id="modMicroarray">Modify a microarray experiment or array design</h3>

    <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">annotare@ebi.ac.uk</a> with the accession number and describe what corrections are needed.  A curator will unload your data from the database, and may be able to do minor corrections such as fixing a few typing errors, before re-loading the corrected version back into the database. Data sets which undergo major changes, such as addition/removal of samples/assays/data files in an experiment, would most likely require re-curation before they are fit for loading into ArrayExpress again, and hence could take a considerable amount of time to complete.</p>

    <h3 id="modSequencing">Modify a sequencing experiment</h3>
    <p>Special rules apply, because the storage of meta-data and raw data files is split between ArrayExpress and <a href="/ena">ENA</a> respectively. Release date changes are possible as long as the experiment remains private.  Citation/publication update is possible at any time. Modification/addition of metadata and/or data files for a private experiment is possible, but often lengthy and tedious. It is therefore important that you get the submission right before you submit.</p>

    <p>If your experiment is still private and an update is required, please email us at <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">annotare@ebi.ac.uk</a> quoting the experiment accession and explaining what changes are needed.  We will advise the next steps accordingly. Depending on your needs, we may append the ENA records with your new data (e.g. addition/removal of samples, sequencing libraries and associated data files) or, in more complicated cases, we may cancel the previously brokered record at ENA and broker your experiment as a brand new submission to ENA (which will generate new ENA accessions). In either case, we will keep the same ArrayExpress accession for your data set, and we'll make sure the ArrayExpress record links to the correct ENA submission.  Please allow up to 15 working days for the update.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is ENA's policy not to make a public experiment private again or cancel it unless there is an exceptional reason. (See <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/data_availability_policy">ENA's Data availability policy</a> for further information.)  Modifying the metadata and/or data files of a public experiment is very tedious, because they would have been mirrored among other <a href='http://www.insdc.org/'>INSDC</a> partners already (namely, <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank'>GenBank</a> and <a href='www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/'>DDBJ</a>).

    <h3 id ="removal">Removal of data from the public domain</h3>
    <p>Data may be be made private again in ArrayExpress (removing both web interface and FTP access) in the
        following circumstances</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submitters realise after their experiment or array design is made public that they failed to request a change to the release date.</li>
        <li>Data is found to be incorrect e.g. sample annotation or sample-data file associations are wrong. The data will be removed from ArrayExpress until the data can be corrected.</li>
        <li>Data are found to have been submitted to ArrayExpress without the permission of the rightful owner; this is expected to be extremely rare and requires formal institutional contact with the submitting institution. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Data is made private again at the next daily update of ArrayExpress where possible. As the data will have been distributed previously as public, ArrayExpress cannot exercise any control on the resultant use of the data by third parties.</p>
    <p>Array designs cannot be made private again if they are linked to a public experiment. Array designs will be kept private if they are
        linked only to private experiments.</p>
    <p>Experiments that have been public may be included in the <a href="/gxa">Expression Atlas</a>. If an experiment is later made private again in ArrayExpress then it will also be removed from the Atlas. However, the Atlas has a monthly, rather daily, release schedule and processed data will be only removed at the next release unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>
    <p>High throughput sequencing read data that is submitted to ArrayExpress, but transferred to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is
        subject to their <a href="/ena/about/data_availability_policy">data release policies</a>. In general, ENA does not turn a public experiment private again unless there is an exceptional reason. Please also refer to our <a href="#modSequencing">policy on updating a sequencing experiment</a> for more details.</p>
