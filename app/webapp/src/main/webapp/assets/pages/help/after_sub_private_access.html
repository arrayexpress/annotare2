  <!-- Change with Biostudies move -->
  <p>Submitters can view all their private experiments and array designs using an ArrayExpress access account. Note that this is a different account to the Annotare login. Submitters are sent details about the access account after a pre-published experiment or array design is loaded into the ArrayExpress database.</p>
  <p>Please refer to this page on <a href="/arrayexpress/help/how_to_search.html#Login">accessing private data</a> on how to use the access account, and how to retrieve login details if you've lost them.</p>

  <!-- Change with Biostudies move -->
  Each reviewer account only gives access to a single experiment or
    array design.</p>

  <a id="double-blind"><h3>3. Submitter anonymity</h3></a>
  <p>To reduce potential bias during peer review, some journals now offer manuscript depositors the option of "double-blind" peer review, where a depositor remains anonymous to the reviewer.  ArrayExpress supports "double-blind" peer review of private data sets by redacting certain meta-data fields which would inevitably reveal the submitter's identity, e.g. "Contacts" (name and email address), "Citation" (contains preliminary publication title and author list). The redaction is an optional feature at submitter's request, and only applies when a reviewer is accessing the ArrayExpress experiment of interest (detected by the reviewer's login name), so the ArrayExpress submitter (using his/her dedicated login) will continue to see the full meta-data record.  Anonymity can also be lifted at submitter's request, e.g. when the manuscript is submitted to a journal which does not support "double-blind" peer review. Finally, submitter anonymity will be lifted completely once the experiment goes public.</p>
  <p>If you are the submitter of a previously non-anonymised private data set in ArrayExpress and would like to switch on anonymity or vice versa, please write to us at <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">annotare@ebi.ac.uk</a>.</p>
