    <h2>Validate your experiment submission</h2>
    <br>
    <a id="validate"></a><h3>What is validation?</h3>
    <p>The validation step aims at catching errors such as missing mandatory information (e.g. public release date, library preparataion protocol for a sequencing experiment, some samples have not been assigned any raw or processed data files), or inconsistencies in your submission (e.g. for a two-colour microarray experiment, a
        hybridisation assay is associated with one labeled extract only but not two).  Having errors like these caught and fixed before
        submission allows us to process your experiment faster for loading into ArrayExpress. You must validate your submission before submitting for curation.</p>
    <p>The checks will be run when you click <code>Validate</code>. It should only take a few seconds:
        <img src="../assets/images/validate_wborder.png" alt="validate" style="width: 50%"/>
    </p>
    <p>You may use the validation throughout your submission to check what still needs to be fixed before the experiment can be submitted.</p>

    <p>If there are no errors, you'll see a message: <code>Validation has been successful</code> and you can proceed to submit the
        experiment to ArrayExpress.</p>
    <p>If however there are errors, they will be listed like this:
        <img src="../assets/images/validate_error_messages.png" alt="validate message" style="width: 80%"/>
    </p>
    <p>The error messages tell you the relevant section of the form that requires changes. You can jump to the section by clicking the link. After stating the problem the messages will also give you a brief explanation of how to fix the error.</p>
    <p>If you need further help with fixing errors, try browsing the <a href="index.html">Annotare guide</a> for the respective section. If you don't find any answers here, drop us a message using the "Contact Us" button from within your submission form.</p>

    <p>If you need further help with fixing errors, please email us at <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">annotare@ebi.ac.uk</a>,
        citing your submission login email, experiment title, and the error message(s) triggered. A curator will investigate and
        suggest solutions.</p>

            <td>An experiment must have at least one experimental variable specified</td>
            <td>An "experimental variable" is the main variable under investigation, often related to
                the hypothesis or intent of the experiment.<br><br>
                For example, for an experiment comparing wild-type against
                knock-out samples, attribute "genotype" should be included (to indicate which samples are
                wild-type and which are knock-out), and the attribute should be indicated as an
                "Experimental Variable". Likewise, "compound" would be an "experimental variable" for an experiment
                comparing samples treated with some drugs/chemicals against untreated controls.<br><br>

                e.g. how the starting materials were grown/sourced/treated, DNA or RNA extraction, data processing steps etc.
                To process your submission we require details of the protocols used.

            <td>A raw data file name must only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores and dots</td>
            <td>File names such as <code>"my file (1).txt"</code> can confuse Annotare processing pipeline since whitespaces, some punctuations and symbols such as brackets could be accidentally misinterpreted as part of the processing code.  So instead of <code>"my file (1).txt"</code>, please use filenames such as <code>"my_file_1.txt"</code> or <code>"myfile.1.txt"</code> instead. In Annotare, in the <a href ="file_upload.html">Upload and assign files section</a>, on the left pane where you've uploaded files either directly or via FTP, you can rename any uploaded file by double-clicking at the file name.

            <td>These errors are often triggered when the data file type (raw, raw matrix, processed or processed matrix) chosen
                does not match the actual content of your uploaded files, e.g. when "processed matrix" type is selected where in fact per-sample processed files (i.e. non-matrix) are provided.  Make sure you've selected the correct file type.
