<h2>About Annotare</h2>
<p>Annotare is a tool for submitting functional genomics experiments to ArrayExpress in MAGE-TAB format. A series of
    webforms (auto-saved as you type) will guide you as you describe the experiment's context, sample annotations,
    protocols employed, and upload raw/processed data files, so there are no Excel spreadsheets to edit. The tool also
    includes features such as "Fill down values" and "Import Values" to populate multiple rows of form efficiently. A
    built-in validation step ensures your submission is in a reasonably good shape prior to being sent to ArrayExpress
    for curation, which means we can issue you an accession number and load the data set into ArrayExpress much
    quicker.</p>
