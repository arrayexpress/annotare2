Investigation Title	RNA and chromatin structure																										
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA and chromatin structure
Experiment Description	We investigated RNAs involved in the maintenance of spatial chromatin organization during interphase. Various RNA fractions from HeLa cells were prepared, tested in in vivo experiments and sequenced in order to identify and characterize the RNA fraction presenting the higher  activity.

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	sequencing	data_transformation																								
Protocol Description	RNA fractions were prepared after cell fractionation starting with 1.10e7 cells.RNA fraction were transformed into cDNA library with solexa adaptors using the standard Illumina protocol.	Sequences were randomly produced at the sequencing facilities.	FASTQ files of sequencing reads were retrieved from the sequencing machine and filtered.																								
Protocol Hardware		Illumina Genome Analyzer II
