Protocol Description	Chemostat cultures were grown at 37 degrees C, pH 6.9, stirring 400 rpm, 0.2h-1 dilution rate in Evans Medium, allowing 5 vessel volumes to reach steady state. Aerobic to anaerobic transitions were carried out by preparing an aerobic steady state (1 L/min air) and then shifting to an anaerobic gas input (1 L/min 5% CO2, 95% N2). Anaerobic to aerobic transitions  were carried out by preparing an anaerobic steady state (1 L/min 5% CO2, 95% N2) and then shifting to 1 L/min air. Samples for RNA analysis were taken just prior to each transition (time zero) and then 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after the gas supply was altered. 	10 ml LB subculture of E. coli K-12 MG1655 was grown at 37C overnight (16 hours) with agitation	Cell samples were taken for future RNA isolation by elution directly into RNAprotect (Qiagen) and the stabilised pellet stored at -80 degrees C following manufacturer's instructions.	The overnight 10 ml subculture of E. coli was spun down at 5000 x g for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. The pellet was not stored and underwent nucleic acid extraction immediately.	RNA was isolated from stored cell pellets using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) following manufacturers instructions. RNA quality was checked by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometrically quantitated.	Genomic DNA was prepared from a 10 ml Escherichia coli MG1655 pellet using the genomic DNA midi kit (Qiagen) following manufacturers instructions. DNA quality was checked by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometrically quantitated.	In a sterile microfuge tube add 2 ug of chromosomal DNA isolated using the Qiagen 'Genomic DNA' Kit (Cat. No.: 19060 for the buffer kit; 10243 for the columns) and bring volume to 21 ul. Add 20 ul of 2.5X Random primer/reaction buffer mix from the Gibco Bioprime DNA labelling system (18094-011). Boil 5 min, then put on ice for 5 min. On ice, add 5 ?l of 10X dNTP mix (10X dNTP mix: 1.2 mM each dATP, dGTP, dTTP; 0.6 mM dCTP; 10 mM Tris pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA; do not use the mix from the kit). Add 3 ul of Cy5-dCTP (1 mM stock, Amersham, Cat. No.PA55021) and 1 ul of Klenow enzyme from the kit. Spin briefly and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 C overnight. Use a Qia-quick PCR purification kit to remove unincorporated/quenched Cy dyes. Elute twice using 50 ul of RNase-free water to maximise recovery. If using labelled genomic DNA as the reference in a type II experiment (DeRisi et al, Science 278: 680-686 (1997)), this protocol supplies sufficient labelled DNA for five hybridisations. 	Set up random priming reactions in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes. Use 16 ug of total RNA and 5 ?g of random hexamers in a total volume of 15 ul of RNase-free water. Incubate 72 C for 10 min then chill for 10 min. Spin briefly in microfuge. Prepare RT reaction mix (sufficient for one labelling reaction). Add: 3.0 ul of 10 X RT buffer, 3.0 ul of 0.1 M DTT, 0.6 ul of 50 X dNTPs*, 5.4 ul of RNAse free water. Add 2 ul of Cy3-dCTP (1 mM stock, Amersham Pharmacia) and 1 ul of 200 U/ul reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen). Incubate 5 min at 25 C and then overnight at 50 C. Add 1.5 ul of 20 mM EDTA to stop RT reaction, then add 15 ul of freshly prepared 0.1 M NaOH and hydrolyse the RNA at 72 C for 10 minutes. Add 15 ul of 0.1 M HCl to neutralise the alkali. Clean up using Qia-quick PCR purification kit eluting in to 100 ul RNase-free water. Each labeling reaction is sufficient for one hybridisation.	Hybridisations were carried out in a type II format (DeRisi et al, Science 278: 680-686 (1997)), whereby labelled RNA (using Cy3-dCTP) was hybridised to a Cy5-labelled cDNA control prepared from genomic DNA, which acts as a reference channel. Cy-3 labelled cDNA sample (from RNA) was combined with 1/5 of a Cy5-labelled cDNA sample (from gDNA), dried down to a few microlitres in a speed-vacuum dessicator and resuspended in 120 ul of salt-based hybridisation buffer (Ocimum Biosolutions). Hybridisation was carried out on OciChip K-12 V2 microarrays (Ocimum Biosolutions) following manufacturers instructions and incubating at 42 C overnight.	Slides were scanned on an Agilent microarray scanner at 10 um resolution and PMT signal settings of 50%. Images were split to provide separate images for each Cy3 and Cy5 channel.	Spot quantitation was carried out using Imagene v5.1 (BioDiscovery).	Initial block-by-block median log normalisation took place using a custom made Microsoft Excel 2002 macro. Firstly data for all controls spots, flagged spots and spots with the Cy3 signal (RNA) less than the Cy5 (gDNA channel) + 2 standard deviations were excluded from further analysis. Then, block-by-block median normalisation was carried out (using natural log ratios), with the data transformed such that the median gene expression ratio (Cy5/Cy3) within each block is 1. The geometric mean of multiple replicates and normalisation of each transition relative to the zero minute timepoint took place within GeneSpring v7.3.1 (Agilent technologies).
