Investigation Title	Natural genetic variation in yeast longevity								
Comment[Submitted Name]	Natural genetic variation in yeast longevity
Experiment Description	A quantitative genetic analysis of the yeast replicative life span was carried out by sampling the natural genetic variation Genomic DNA was extracted from 39 recombinant lines from a cross between strains S96 and YJM 789.

Protocol Description	The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.	DNA was fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Genomic DNA was isolated using Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G columns, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Yeast recombinant lines were grown according to standard conditions.	As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)	Raw output CEL files were converted from compressed binary CEL files to CEL text files using Affymetrix CEL file conversion tool (https://www.affymetrix.com/support/file_download.affx?onloadforward=/support/developer/downloads/Tools/CelFileConversion.ZIP). CEL files were imported into Allelescan (http://med.stanford.edu/sgtc/research/download/) and data quality was determined for parental and recombinant strains by using Allelescan’s quality check for controls, markers, hybridizations, and replicates. Genotype Call: 0 (S96), 2 (YJM789) provided in the Series supplementary file
